# Virus Attack
“Virus Attack” is a game we have decided to develop as a project for CS 319 course. There is a virus that tries to get into human body, and player controls the virus’ motions. The main purpose of this game is to avoid colliding with the host body’s immune system by moving and dodging appropriately, and to be alive as much as you can in the host body. The game we took as an inspiration is the indie game called “Wave 2” made by the YouTube channel RealTutsGML.
The game will have some modifications such as different types of immune system cells and bonus features for the virus ( player ). The virus will try to escape from immune system’s attack which are controlled by the computer itself, if virus can survive for the given time it will accomplish the current level and move on to the next one which will be harder. Every level will have different types of immune system cells and virus attribute such as strength of virus against the immune system. If the virus gets hit by the immune system cells, the virus will lose its health points. The health of the virus is shown on top of the screen. If this bar goes empty, the virus will die and the game will be over.
The game will be a desktop application and controlled by a keyboard.
